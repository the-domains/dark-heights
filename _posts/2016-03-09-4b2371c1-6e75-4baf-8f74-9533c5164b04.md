"Do you remember that night?" she said.  "You and I sat on that bench together, talking for hours, looking out over the city.  And then the sun rose."

"Of course I remember it," he said.

"That was the last time I was happy," she said.  "Everything made sense that night.  And then--then everything changed."

He looked at her.  "What happened to you, Tess?"

"I can't tell you yet," she said.  "There's something you have to do for me first."
