"Do you remember that night?" she said.  "You and I were there for hours, talking, looking out over the city.  And then the sun rose.  I was happy.  I think you were, too.  Now so much has happened to us.  I'm not the same.  I can't go back.  I can't close my eyes again, no matter how much I want to.  And neither can you."

**A new webfiction saga of Weird, Supernatural Suspense is about to begin...........**
